# Fit-tionary
Fit-tionary identifies the name of an unknown workout by viewing instances of the unknown workout, which is then transferred over to an AI search engine that will be trained to recognize, obtain and give out the standard name of the workout. Additionally, the system will give out other details such as the targeted muscle areas, workout difficulty, etc.
